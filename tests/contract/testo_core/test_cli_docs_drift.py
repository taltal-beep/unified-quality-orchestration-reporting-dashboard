"""Guard against `docs/CLI Commands/Command Reference.md` documenting a
`testo` subcommand that doesn't actually exist in the Typer app.

This test exists because doctor/clean/watch/init were fully documented
(flags, exit codes, sample output) while only living on an unmerged
feature branch — anyone on `main` got "No such command" for all four.
Nothing caught that drift. This test reads the same doc humans read and
asserts every `` `testo <name>` `` command header resolves in the CLI.
