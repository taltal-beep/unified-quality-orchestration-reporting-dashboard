## Workstream 1: Merge Draft PRs (Critical Bugs & Coverage)

**Why:** 16 draft PRs contain correctness fixes and test coverage that must land before any release gate can pass. Critical bugs in report artifact paths could cause data loss or broken reports in production.

## Workstream 2: Release Gate Execution

**Why:** All 8 release checklists have 0/210 items checked. The roadmap says phases are "done" but the operational go/no-go gates were never run. Without formal sign-off, there's no proof of release readiness.

**Execution order:** Phase 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 (each phase builds on prior).

## Workstream 3: Persistence Module

**Why:** `orchestrator.py:228` promises `testo_core.persistence` for Phase 4. The engine layer currently writes `plan_result.json` only. The services layer has DB persistence (`headless_engine.py`, `run_history.py`), but the engine doesn't. This is confusing and the `--no-persist` flag name is misleading.

**Decision needed:** Build the module, or formally document JSON-only approach and rename flags.

### 3.1 Option A: Implement Persistence Module

| # | Task | Priority | Effort | Depends On |
|---|------|----------|--------|------------|
| 3.1.1 | Design `testo_core/persistence/` module interface: what data flows from engine to DB | P0 | S | — |
| 3.1.2 | Create `testo_core/persistence/__init__.py` with `PersistenceBackend` protocol | P0 | S | 3.1.1 |
| 3.1.3 | Create `testo_core/persistence/json_backend.py` — extract current `_try_persist` logic | P0 | M | 3.1.2 |
| 3.1.4 | Create `testo_core/persistence/db_backend.py` — wire to existing `RunRepository` | P0 | M | 3.1.2 |
| 3.1.5 | Integrate persistence backend into `orchestrator.run_plan()` replacing `_try_persist` | P0 | M | 3.1.3, 3.1.4 |
| 3.1.6 | Update `--no-persist` / `--persist` CLI flags with clear semantics | P0 | S | 3.1.5 |
| 3.1.7 | Add unit tests for JSON and DB persistence backends | P0 | M | 3.1.5 |
| 3.1.8 | Update `orchestrator.py` docstring to remove "wired up in Phase 4" reference | P0 | XS | 3.1.5 |
| 3.1.9 | Update `docs/Architecture/Architecture Overview.md` with persistence layer | P1 | S | 3.1.5 |
| 3.1.10 | Update Technical Debt Tracker item #4 as fixed | P1 | XS | 3.1.5 |

### 3.2 Option B: Document JSON-Only Approach

| # | Task | Priority | Effort | Depends On |
|---|------|----------|--------|------------|
| 3.2.1 | Rename `--no-persist` to `--no-artifact-json` or similar | P0 | S | — |
| 3.2.2 | Update `orchestrator.py` docstring to reflect JSON-only design decision | P0 | XS | — |
| 3.2.3 | Document that DB persistence lives in services layer, not engine layer | P0 | S | — |
| 3.2.4 | Add ADR: "Engine persistence is JSON-only; DB persistence via services" | P1 | S | 3.2.3 |
| 3.2.5 | Update Technical Debt Tracker item #4 to "Resolved — by design" | P1 | XS | 3.2.2 |

---

## Workstream 4: Consolidate Dual Execution Stacks

**Why:** Modern engine (`orchestrator.py` + `executor.py`) and legacy stack (`headless_engine.py` + `runners.py`) have duplicate `EngineExitCode`, duplicate classification logic, and risk behavioral drift. Tech Debt Tracker items #2 and #12.

| # | Task | Priority | Effort | Depends On |
|---|------|----------|--------|------------|
| 4.1 | Audit: map all callers of `headless_engine.py` vs `orchestrator.py` — document which CLI/API paths use which | P1 | M | 1.1.* |
| 4.2 | Single-source `EngineExitCode`: keep in `engine/exit_codes.py`, import in `headless_engine.py` | P1 | S | 4.1 |
| 4.3 | Single-source `classify_exit_code`: remove duplicate from `headless_engine.py` | P1 | S | 4.2 |
| 4.4 | Replace literal exit code constants in CLI (`raise typer.Exit(code=2)`) with `EngineExitCode.INVALID_INPUT` | P2 | S | 4.2 |
| 4.5 | Add contract test asserting both stacks produce identical exit codes for same inputs | P1 | M | 4.3 |
| 4.6 | Document boundary: which stack handles what (in Architecture Overview or ADR) | P1 | S | 4.1 |
| 4.7 | Long-term: design `RunBackend` protocol with host and Docker implementations | P3 | L | 4.6 |
| 4.8 | Update Technical Debt Tracker items #2, #6, #12 as resolved | P1 | XS | 4.3, 4.4 |

---

## Workstream 5: Exception Handling Hardening

**Why:** Broad `except Exception` in Docker/S3/reporter paths causes silent degradation — empty reports, stale DB rows, swallowed errors. Tech Debt Tracker items #5, #7, #8, #9, #10.

| # | Task | Priority | Effort | Depends On |
|---|------|----------|--------|------------|
| 5.1 | Audit: list all `except Exception` sites in `runners.py`, `run_history.py`, reporter clients | P2 | S | — |
| 5.2 | Narrow `runners.py` Docker exception handlers to `docker.errors.DockerException`, `OSError`, `TimeoutError` | P2 | M | 5.1 |
| 5.3 | Narrow `run_history.py` S3/DB handlers to `ClientError`, `SQLAlchemyError` | P2 | M | 5.1 |
| 5.4 | Narrow reporter exception handlers (`extent_reporter.py`, `reportportal_client.py`, `testbeats_reporter.py`) | P2 | M | 5.1 |
| 5.5 | Add `logger.warning(..., exc_info=True)` to all narrowed handlers | P2 | S | 5.2–5.4 |
| 5.6 | Fix swallowed BehaveX/native report errors: set `StageResult.error` when HTML generation fails | P2 | S | — |
| 5.7 | Reporter factory: add `reporters_required` config option or emit `reporter_failed` NDJSON event | P2 | M | 5.4 |
| 5.8 | Git trigger fallback: emit `{"event":"trigger_fallback","mode":"snapshot","reason":"..."}` NDJSON when `--ci` | P2 | S | — |
| 5.9 | Orchestrator defensive catch: re-raise `KeyboardInterrupt`/`SystemExit`, narrow to adapter errors, use exit 4 for internal | P2 | S | — |
| 5.10 | Update Technical Debt Tracker items #5, #7, #8, #9, #10 as resolved | P2 | XS | 5.2–5.9 |

---

## Workstream 6: Documentation & CHANGELOG

**Why:** No CHANGELOG exists. README may lack CI quickstarts. Docs lack "last updated" dates. Release checklists serve as templates but don't record actual sign-offs.

| # | Task | Priority | Effort | Depends On |
|---|------|----------|--------|------------|
| 6.1 | Create `CHANGELOG.md` at repo root with entries for all 4 phases derived from git history | P0 | M | — |
| 6.2 | Add Phase 1 changelog entry: DB adapters, PyPI packaging, headless CLI | P0 | XS | 6.1 |
| 6.3 | Add Phase 2 changelog entry: GitHub Action, GitLab template, Ghost mode, Runner image | P0 | XS | 6.1 |
| 6.4 | Add Phase 3 changelog entry: React frontend, Delta comparison, Unified dashboard | P0 | XS | 6.1 |
| 6.5 | Add Phase 4 changelog entry: BYOK AI, Context-aware failure analysis | P0 | XS | 6.1 |
| 6.6 | Verify README contains GitHub Action quickstart snippet | P1 | S | — |
| 6.7 | Verify README contains GitLab template quickstart snippet | P1 | S | — |
| 6.8 | Verify README contains required variables/secrets section | P1 | S | — |
| 6.9 | Verify README contains troubleshooting section | P1 | S | — |
| 6.10 | Add frontmatter `last-updated: YYYY-MM-DD` to all docs in `docs/Architecture/` | P3 | S | — |
| 6.11 | Add frontmatter `last-updated: YYYY-MM-DD` to all docs in `docs/CLI Commands/` | P3 | S | — |
| 6.12 | Add frontmatter `last-updated: YYYY-MM-DD` to all docs in `docs/Specs & ADRs/` | P3 | S | — |

---

## Workstream 7: PyPI Publish Pipeline

**Why:** Phase 1 promises `pip install testo-core`. The package is not on PyPI and no publish workflow exists.

| # | Task | Priority | Effort | Depends On |
|---|------|----------|--------|------------|
| 7.1 | Register `testo-core` package name on PyPI (or Test PyPI first) | P0 | S | — |
| 7.2 | Create `.github/workflows/publish.yml` — triggered on GitHub Release tag push | P0 | M | 7.1 |
| 7.3 | Configure trusted publisher (OIDC) for GitHub → PyPI auth (no API token in secrets) | P0 | S | 7.1 |
| 7.4 | Add `python -m build` and `twine check dist/*` to publish workflow | P0 | S | 7.2 |
| 7.5 | Add Test PyPI dry-run step before real publish | P1 | S | 7.2 |
| 7.6 | Test end-to-end: create a test release, verify `pip install testo-core` works from PyPI | P0 | M | 7.4 |
| 7.7 | Document publish process in `docs/Processes & Guides/Publishing to PyPI.md` | P1 | S | 7.6 |

---

## Workstream 8: Docker Image Publish Pipeline

**Why:** `Dockerfile.testo-runner` exists but has no CI for building/pushing to a registry. Phase 2 promises a pre-built runner image.

| # | Task | Priority | Effort | Depends On |
|---|------|----------|--------|------------|
| 8.1 | Choose container registry (GitHub Container Registry recommended — free for public repos) | P1 | XS | — |
| 8.2 | Create `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` — triggered on release tag | P1 | M | 8.1 |
| 8.3 | Add multi-arch build support (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`) via `docker buildx` | P2 | S | 8.2 |
| 8.4 | Add image scanning step (e.g. `trivy`) to CI before publish | P2 | S | 8.2 |
| 8.5 | Tag images with semver + `latest` + commit SHA | P1 | S | 8.2 |
| 8.6 | Test end-to-end: pull published image, run `uqo run --help` | P1 | S | 8.5 |
| 8.7 | Update README with published image pull command | P1 | XS | 8.6 |
| 8.8 | Update `docker-compose.yml` to use published image instead of local build | P2 | S | 8.6 |

---

## Workstream 9: Streamlit Legacy Cleanup

**Why:** `testo_ui/` (Streamlit) still exists alongside React frontend. No formal deprecation or removal plan. Running both causes confusion about which UI is "official."

| # | Task | Priority | Effort | Depends On |
|---|------|----------|--------|------------|
| 9.1 | Confirm React frontend covers all Streamlit UI functionality (feature parity audit) | P1 | M | 2.3.* |
| 9.2 | Add deprecation warning to `testo-ui` entrypoint: "Streamlit UI is deprecated, use React frontend" | P1 | XS | 9.1 |
| 9.3 | Remove `UQO_UI_MODE=dual|streamlit` mode toggle logic | P2 | S | 9.2 |
| 9.4 | Remove `testo_ui/` directory and `testo-ui` entrypoint from `pyproject.toml` | P2 | S | 9.3 |
| 9.5 | Remove `streamlit` from `[ui]` extras in `pyproject.toml` | P2 | XS | 9.4 |
| 9.6 | Update `docs/Processes & Guides/Streamlit to React Migration Guide.md` to mark migration complete | P2 | XS | 9.4 |
| 9.7 | Remove dual-mode integration tests (`tests/integration/test_dual_mode_ui.py` if exists) | P2 | XS | 9.4 |

---

## Workstream 10: Version Bump & v1.0 Release

**Why:** Version is still `0.1.0` despite 4 phases of features. The final step is tagging and publishing v1.0.0.

| # | Task | Priority | Effort | Depends On |
|---|------|----------|--------|------------|
| 10.1 | Bump version to `1.0.0` in `pyproject.toml` | P0 | XS | All P0 tasks |
| 10.2 | Final CHANGELOG entry for v1.0.0 | P0 | S | 6.1, 10.1 |
| 10.3 | Create Git tag `v1.0.0` | P0 | XS | 10.2 |
| 10.4 | Create GitHub Release from tag with changelog notes | P0 | S | 10.3 |
| 10.5 | Verify PyPI publish triggered and successful | P0 | S | 7.*, 10.4 |
| 10.6 | Verify Docker image publish triggered and successful | P1 | S | 8.*, 10.4 |
| 10.7 | Smoke test: `pip install testo-core==1.0.0` in clean venv → `testo --version` | P0 | XS | 10.5 |
| 10.8 | Announce release (README badge, GitHub Release notes) | P1 | S | 10.7 |
